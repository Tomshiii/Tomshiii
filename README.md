My name is Tom or Tomshi, I'm a video editor & prior content creator.

Coding isn't really my thing and I barely understand what I'm doing most of the time. I only have a rudimentary understanding of a few languages (mainly ahk).

I am mainly using github to keep track of my scripts in [Tomshiii/ahk](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk)
