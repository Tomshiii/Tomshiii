My name is Tom or Tomshi, I'm a [twitch.tv partner](https://www.twitch.tv/tomshi) and a [youtube creator](https://www.youtube.com/c/tomshiii).

Coding isn't really my thing for the most part, I only really have rudimentary understanding of a few languages (mainly ahk)

I am mainly using github to keep track of my scripts in [Tomshiii/ahk](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk)
